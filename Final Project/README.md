### Introduction

Food. Everyone loves it, everyone has it. Everyone even talks about it. Food is something we can talk about for hours and hours. India is rightly called the Land of Spices. No country in the world produces as many varieties of spices as India. The restaurant industry in India has witnessed an unprecedented transformation with the entry of a variety of national and international players. This has, in turn, given birth to a huge demand for qualified professionals in the sector and all related industries. Thanks to the technological revolution, Indian restaurant setups have now gone online to gain more customers and serve them better.

But the demand-and-supply graph isn’t quite the way it should be. With a noticeable shortage of skilled professionals, the restaurant industry presents a whole gamut of opportunities waiting to be grabbed. Enter culinary arts institutes. Traditional cooking schools and hotel management colleges have now expanded the range of education they offer in order to satisfy industry demands. Indian universities are investing time and money to train students to make them able and employable. 

It’s not surprising that the higher frequency of eating out has also evolved the market for the food services sector. The Indian food service market has come a long way from the early Nineties when it was dominated by unorganised players and few brands.

The revolution began in 1996 with McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Domino’s Pizza, Subway and Yo!China, among others, setting up shop in the country. Since then, the food services market has been continuously growing.

The good news is that the food services industry is set to grow for many years to come, given the rising disposable incomes, a greater population of younger people, the growth of consumers in smaller towns and the widening exposure to new cultures and cuisines besides an increased propensity of eating outside the home. The analysis will mainly help new restaurants in examining the factors affecting their restaurant location.

### Purpose of study

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the aggregate rating of each restaurant, establishment of different types of restaurant at different places, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 50,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry has'nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day  by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don't have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian. These kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as

<ul>
  <li>Approx Price of food</li>
  <li>Location of the restaurant</li>
  <li>Theme based restaurant or not</li>
  <li>Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants</li>
  <li>The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood</li>
  <li>Is a particular neighborhood famous for its own kind of food.</li>
</ul>
